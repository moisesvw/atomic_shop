# ADR-0001: Adopting Atomic Design for Ruby/Rails

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Traditional Rails applications often struggle with several architectural challenges as they grow:

1. **Component Reusability**: View partials and service objects become tightly coupled, making reuse difficult
2. **Testing Complexity**: Large, monolithic services and views are hard to test in isolation
3. **Code Organization**: No clear hierarchy for organizing components by complexity
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component often require modifications to many others
5. **Team Scalability**: New developers struggle to understand where to place new functionality

We needed an architectural pattern that would:
- Promote clear separation of concerns
- Enable component reusability
- Provide natural testing boundaries
- Scale well with team size and application complexity
- Maintain Rails conventions while adding structure

## Decision

We will adopt **Atomic Design principles**, originally created by Brad Frost for frontend development, and adapt them for Ruby/Rails backend development. This involves:

### Service Layer Atomicity
```
ðŸ”¬ Atoms: Single-purpose utilities (ProductFinder, InventoryChecker)
ðŸ§ª Molecules: Composed business logic (ProductDetailsService)
ðŸ¦  Organisms: Complex workflows (ProductDetailPageService)
```

### ViewComponent Hierarchy
```
ðŸ”¬ Atoms: Basic UI elements (ButtonComponent, PriceComponent)
ðŸ§ª Molecules: Composed UI components (ProductCardComponent)
ðŸ¦  Organisms: Complex UI sections (ProductDetailComponent)
ðŸ“„ Templates: Layout structures (ProductDetailTemplateComponent)
ðŸ“± Pages: Complete experiences (ProductDetailPageComponent)
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Strict Directory Structure**: Organize code by atomic level
2. **Dependency Rules**: Higher levels can depend on lower levels, never the reverse
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each atomic level has clear, distinct responsibilities
4. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complexity through composition
5. **Testing Alignment**: Test strategy follows atomic boundaries

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

#### Enhanced Modularity
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each atomic level has well-defined responsibilities
- **Reduced Coupling**: Components depend only on lower-level atoms
- **Easier Refactoring**: Changes are isolated to specific atomic levels

#### Improved Testability
- **Natural Isolation**: Atoms can be tested without any dependencies
- **Mockable Interfaces**: Molecules can be tested by mocking their atomic dependencies
- **Clear Test Scope**: Each test focuses on a single atomic level

#### Better Code Organization
- **Intuitive Structure**: Developers know exactly where to find and place code
- **Scalable Architecture**: Pattern scales from simple to complex applications
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same principles apply across all features

#### Team Benefits
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can understand the system incrementally
- **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different atomic levels simultaneously
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Common vocabulary and patterns across the team

### Negative Consequences

#### Learning Curve
- **New Concepts**: Team needs to learn atomic design principles
- **Pattern Discipline**: Requires discipline to maintain atomic boundaries
- **Initial Overhead**: More files and structure for simple features

#### Potential Over-Engineering
- **Simple Features**: May be overkill for very simple functionality
- **Abstraction Cost**: Additional layers can obscure simple operations
- **Performance Overhead**: More objects and method calls

#### Maintenance Overhead
- **Documentation**: Requires maintaining documentation about atomic patterns
- **Code Reviews**: Need to ensure atomic principles are followed
- **Refactoring**: Moving between atomic levels requires careful consideration

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Rails MVC
**Pros**: Simple, well-understood, minimal overhead
**Cons**: Poor scalability, tight coupling, difficult testing
**Verdict**: Rejected due to scalability and maintainability concerns

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**Pros**: Strong domain modeling, clear boundaries
**Cons**: Complex for e-commerce domain, steep learning curve
**Verdict**: Too complex for our current needs, may consider for future

### Service Object Pattern (without atomic hierarchy)
**Pros**: Better than traditional MVC, good separation of concerns
**Cons**: No clear organization principle, can become unwieldy
**Verdict**: Good foundation but lacks organizational structure

### Component-Based Architecture (without atomic principles)
**Pros**: Good reusability, clear component boundaries
**Cons**: No hierarchy guidance, can lead to inconsistent organization
**Verdict**: Missing the systematic approach of atomic design

## Implementation Notes

### Directory Structure
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/          # Single-purpose utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/      # Composed business logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ organisms/      # Complex workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/          # Basic UI elements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/      # Composed UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ organisms/      # Complex UI sections
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/      # Layout structures
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/          # Complete experiences
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Services**: `Services::Atoms::ProductFinder`
- **Components**: `Atoms::ButtonComponent`
- **Tests**: Follow the same atomic hierarchy

### Dependency Rules
1. **Atoms**: No dependencies on other application code
2. **Molecules**: Can depend on atoms only
3. **Organisms**: Can depend on atoms and molecules
4. **Templates**: Can depend on atoms, molecules, and organisms
5. **Pages**: Can depend on all lower levels

### Testing Strategy
- **Atoms**: Pure unit tests with no mocking
- **Molecules**: Unit tests with mocked atomic dependencies
- **Organisms**: Integration tests with real atoms, mocked external services
- **Components**: ViewComponent tests with appropriate mocking

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching**: Implement at atomic level for maximum reusability
- **Lazy Loading**: Use in molecules and organisms to avoid unnecessary computation
- **Memoization**: Apply in atoms for expensive operations

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of this decision by:

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >95% coverage across all atomic levels
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep individual atoms simple (complexity < 5)
- **Code Duplication**: Reduce duplication through atomic reusability

### Development Metrics
- **Feature Development Time**: Track time to implement new features
- **Bug Fix Time**: Measure time to locate and fix issues
- **Code Review Time**: Monitor time spent in code reviews

### Team Metrics
- **Onboarding Time**: Time for new developers to become productive
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Survey team satisfaction with architecture
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Frequency of architectural discussions

## Review Schedule

This ADR will be reviewed:
- **Quarterly**: Assess effectiveness and gather team feedback
- **After Major Features**: Evaluate how well atomic design supported development
- **When Issues Arise**: If atomic boundaries become problematic
