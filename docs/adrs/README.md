# ðŸ“‹ Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that document the key architectural decisions made during the development of Atomic Shop. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of important architectural choices.

## ADR Format

We follow the standard ADR format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were evaluated?]

## Implementation Notes
[Technical details about how this decision is implemented]
```

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR file following the naming convention: `XXXX-decision-title.md`
2. Use the next available number in sequence
3. Follow the standard ADR format
4. Update this index
5. Link to the ADR from relevant documentation

## Decision Criteria

We evaluate architectural decisions based on:

### Primary Criteria
- **Maintainability**: How easy is it to modify and extend?
- **Testability**: How well does it support comprehensive testing?
- **Performance**: What are the performance implications?
- **Security**: How does it affect application security?

### Secondary Criteria
- **Developer Experience**: How does it affect development productivity?
- **Learning Curve**: How easy is it for new team members to understand?
- **Community Support**: How well supported is the technology/pattern?
- **Future Flexibility**: How well does it support future changes?

## Review Process

All ADRs should be:

1. **Reviewed** by at least one other team member
2. **Discussed** in team meetings for major decisions
3. **Updated** when circumstances change
4. **Referenced** in code comments and documentation

## Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Benefits of ADRs

### For Current Development
- **Clarity**: Clear reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Consistency**: Ensures decisions align with project goals
- **Communication**: Facilitates team discussions about architecture

### For Future Development
- **Context**: Provides historical context for decisions
- **Evolution**: Shows how architecture has evolved over time
- **Learning**: Helps new team members understand the system

### For Documentation
- **Traceability**: Links decisions to implementation
- **Justification**: Explains why certain patterns were chosen
- **Alternatives**: Documents what was considered but not chosen

## Example ADR Structure

Here's an example of how we document decisions:

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Adopting Atomic Design for Ruby/Rails

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional Rails applications often struggle with component reusability and 
clear separation of concerns, especially as they grow in complexity. We need 
an architectural pattern that promotes modularity, testability, and 
maintainability while being natural to Ruby/Rails development.

## Decision
We will adopt Atomic Design principles, adapting them for Ruby/Rails 
development by applying the atomic hierarchy to both service layers and 
view components.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear component hierarchy and responsibilities
- Improved testability through natural isolation boundaries
- Better code reusability across the application
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### Negative
- Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Atomic Design
- Potential over-engineering for simple features
- Need for discipline to maintain atomic boundaries

## Alternatives Considered
- Traditional Rails MVC without additional patterns
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach
- Component-based architecture without atomic hierarchy

## Implementation Notes
- Services organized in atoms/ molecules/ organisms/ directories
- ViewComponents following the same atomic hierarchy
- Testing strategy aligned with atomic boundaries
- Documentation emphasizing atomic design principles
```

## Maintenance

ADRs should be:

- **Living Documents**: Updated when decisions change
- **Linked**: Referenced from relevant code and documentation
- **Reviewed**: Periodically evaluated for relevance
- **Archived**: Moved to archive when no longer applicable

This approach ensures our architectural decisions are well-documented, 
justified, and maintainable over time.
