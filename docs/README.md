# 🧬 Atomic Shop: The Ultimate Ruby/Rails Atomic Design Showcase

> **🤖 AI-Generated Educational Resource**: This project and its comprehensive documentation are developed using AI assistance to demonstrate best practices in software engineering, atomic design patterns, and Ruby/Rails development. It serves as an educational resource and reference implementation for engineering teams.

Welcome to **Atomic Shop** - a comprehensive demonstration of Atomic Design principles applied to Ruby on Rails development. This project serves as both a functional e-commerce application and an educational resource for software engineers seeking to understand advanced architectural patterns.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project demonstrates how **Atomic Design methodology** - traditionally used in frontend development - can be brilliantly adapted to backend Ruby/Rails development, creating a highly modular, testable, and maintainable codebase.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Atomic Design Hierarchy

Our implementation follows a strict atomic hierarchy across both **Service Layer** and **View Layer**:

```
🔬 ATOMS (Smallest Units)
├── Services: ProductFinder, VariantFinder, InventoryChecker
└── Components: ButtonComponent, PriceComponent, RatingComponent

🧪 MOLECULES (Composed Units)
├── Services: ProductDetailsService, VariantSelectionService
└── Components: ProductCardComponent, VariantSelectorComponent

🦠 ORGANISMS (Complex Structures)
├── Services: ProductDetailPageService, OrderProcessingService
└── Components: ProductDetailComponent, CheckoutComponent

📄 TEMPLATES (Layout Structures)
└── Components: ProductDetailTemplateComponent, CheckoutTemplateComponent

📱 PAGES (Complete Experiences)
└── Components: ProductDetailPageComponent, CheckoutPageComponent
```

### Technology Stack

- **Ruby 3.3.5** with **Rails 8.0.2**
- **ViewComponent 3.22** for atomic UI components
- **Interactor 3.1** for service composition
- **dry-validation 1.11** & **dry-monads 1.8** for functional programming
- **Pundit 2.5** for authorization policies
- **Solid Cache/Queue/Cable** for modern Rails infrastructure
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)** for reactive interfaces
