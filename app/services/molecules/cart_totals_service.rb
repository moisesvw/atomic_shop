    # ðŸ§ª Molecule Service: Cart Totals Service
    #
    # This molecule service composes atomic services to calculate comprehensive
    # cart totals including subtotals, discounts, taxes, and shipping costs.
    # It demonstrates how pricing calculations can be composed from atomic
    # building blocks to create complex pricing workflows.
    #
    # Atomic Design Principles:
    # - Composes Multiple Atoms: Uses PriceCalculator, DiscountCalculator, ShippingCalculator
    # - Single Business Purpose: Calculates all cart totals and pricing
    # - Testable Through Mocking: Can mock atomic dependencies
    # - Reusable Workflow: Used by checkout, cart display, and order processing
    #
    # Usage Examples:
    #   service = Services::Molecules::CartTotalsService.new(cart: cart)
    #   result = service.calculate_totals
    #   result = service.calculate_with_shipping(shipping_method)
