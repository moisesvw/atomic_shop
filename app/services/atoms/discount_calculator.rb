    # ðŸ”¬ Atomic Service: Discount Calculator
    #
    # This atomic service handles discount calculations for cart items,
    # including percentage discounts, fixed amount discounts, and
    # quantity-based discounts. It provides pure calculation logic
    # without dependencies on other services.
    #
    # Atomic Design Principles:
    # - Single Responsibility: Only handles discount calculations
    # - No Dependencies: Pure mathematical calculations
    # - Highly Reusable: Used across pricing workflows
    # - Easy to Test: Deterministic calculation functions
    #
    # Usage Examples:
    #   calculator = Services::Atoms::DiscountCalculator.new
    #   discount = calculator.percentage_discount(1000, 10) # 10% off $10.00
    #   discount = calculator.fixed_discount(1000, 200)     # $2.00 off $10.00
