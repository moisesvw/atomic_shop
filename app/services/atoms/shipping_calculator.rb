    # ðŸ”¬ Atomic Service: Shipping Calculator
    #
    # This atomic service handles shipping cost calculations based on
    # various factors like weight, distance, shipping method, and cart value.
    # It provides pure calculation logic for shipping costs.
    #
    # Atomic Design Principles:
    # - Single Responsibility: Only handles shipping calculations
    # - No Dependencies: Pure mathematical calculations
    # - Highly Reusable: Used across checkout workflows
    # - Easy to Test: Deterministic calculation functions
    #
    # Usage Examples:
    #   calculator = Services::Atoms::ShippingCalculator.new
    #   cost = calculator.calculate_shipping(cart, shipping_method)
    #   cost = calculator.free_shipping_threshold(cart_total, threshold)
