## Atomic Shop: Experimenting with Atomic Design in Ruby

> **ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Project**: This project is developed using AI assistance to demonstrate best practices in software engineering, atomic design patterns, and Ruby/Rails development. It serves as an educational resource and reference implementation.

Welcome to the **Atomic Shop** project! This is an experimental venture into applying Atomic Design principlesâ€”a methodology introduced by Brad Frost in 2013â€”within the Ruby ecosystem.
While Atomic Design is widely recognized as a powerful methodology for organizing user interface (UI) components in frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, and Angular), this project explores its adaptability and relevance when applied to backend development and the Ruby programming language. Specifically, the Atomic Shop investigates how well the principles of modularity, hierarchy, and composition can bridge both the **view layer** and **business logic** in Ruby applications.
## What is Atomic Design?
Atomic Design organizes systems into five key hierarchical levels:
1. **Atoms**: The smallest, indivisible components (e.g., buttons, input fields in UI).
2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms functioning together cohesively (e.g., a form with input and button).
3. **Organisms**: Complex structures built from molecules and/or atoms (e.g., headers, footers).
4. **Templates**: Layout structures that organize organisms and provide a content skeleton.
5. **Pages**: Fully instantiated templates representing the end-user experience.

These principles promote **reusability, scalability, and maintainability**.
## Translating Atomic Design to Ruby
Atomic Design principles, although UI-focused, can conceptually be adapted to Ruby for:
1. **Views**: Organizing templates, partials, and components in Ruby frameworks.
2. **Business Logic**: Structuring value objects, service objects, and workflows.

### Layered Approach in Ruby
**Views (Frontend in Ruby)**:
- **Atoms**: Individual helpers, reusable components (e.g., a single ViewComponent in Rails).
- **Molecules**: UI compositions like forms or small encapsulated partials.
- **Organisms**: Larger reusable structures like feature sections or navbars.
- **Templates/Pages**: Combine views into structured layouts that match Atomic Design's goals.

**Business Logic**:
- **Atoms**: Basic utility classes, validators, or plain data objects.
- **Molecules**: Services combining logic, such as payment or email sending processes.
- **Organisms**: High-level orchestrators handling significant workflows composed of molecules.
- **Templates and Pages**: Full workflows mirroring distinct use cases.

## Objectives of the Atomic Shop Project
The goal of this project is two-fold:
1. **Evaluate Feasibility**: Determine if Atomic Design principles can be seamlessly adapted to Ruby, both in its view components and business layers.
2. **Discover Best Practices**: Experiment with libraries and frameworks that align closely with Atomic Design, such as:
    - **ViewComponent** (GitHub's reusable view component framework for Rails).
    - **Trailblazer** (an architecture pattern aligning Ruby business logic to a structured hierarchy).
    - **dry-rb** libraries (functional programming tools).
    - **Rails Partials/Helpers** (following Atomic Design-inspired organization).

### Tools & Frameworks Explored
- **Ruby on Rails**: The primary web framework used to examine Atomic hierarchy concepts.
- **ViewComponent Gem**: For reusable view encapsulation.
- **Trailblazer**: To explore atomic units in business logic.
- **dry-rb Libraries**: For composable and functional-style Ruby code.

## Project Structure
The project adopts a folder structure inspired by Atomic Design principles:
``` 
atomic_shop/
â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/         # Smallest, reusable building blocks (helpers, simple components)
â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/     # Composed logic or smaller UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ organisms/     # Large, reusable sections of functionality or UI
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/     # Structured layouts for views or workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Complete end-user-facing workflows
```
## Conclusion
This repository is an experiment, designed to question and explore the adaptability of **Atomic Design**â€”a concept with a strong UI heritageâ€”in the realm of backend development with Ruby. Specifically, **Atomic Shop** seeks to uncover whether such methodologies can enrich Ruby applications in terms of structure, reusability, and maintainability.
Your feedback and contributions are welcome as we continue this experiment in modular design principles!
